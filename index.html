            <p>I am Asahel Mariquit. I live in Marinduque Philippines. After serving on a mission at Philippines Laoag
                Mission, I erolled in BYU Pathway. After I completed PC 101 - 103, I started my first certificate. That
                also
                started my journey towards a Software Development degree. This is my second time taking this course.
                I had some challenges last term which prevented me from accomplishing this course requirements. Now, I
                believe I can do it.
                My perspective of the future is bright. I enjoy studying this course a lot. I have always been
                interested in
                programming. Now that I am able to do that, it just amazing. In my free time, I like to read the
                scriptures
                and play musical
                instruments. I play the piano and guitar but I also started learning how to play the saxophone.
                I also like to sing. Just to give a little update, I have been too busy that I stopped learning
                saxophone. I
                still play the piano though. I also find myself listening to a lot of music lately. For me, music is so
                comforting. That's probably the reason why I listen to it a lot.</p>
