        <p>I am Asahel Mariquit. I live in Marinduque Philippines. This is my second time taking this course.
            I had some challenges last term that prevented me from accomplishing this course requirements. Now, I
            believe I can do it.
            My perspective of the future is bright. In my free time, I like to read the scriptures and play musical
            instruments. I play the piano and guitar but I also started learning how to play the saxophone.
            I like to sing.</p>
